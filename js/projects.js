 * Project list for the Dream Team Hub home page.

 * To add a project, append an object to this array:
 *   title       ~ shown at the bottom of the card
 *   description ~ shown when hovering over the card (keep it to 1~3 sentences)
 *   subdomain   ~ the card links to https://<subdomain>.dreamteamhub.ca
 *                 (use `url` instead to link somewhere else entirely)
 *   image       ~ path to an image in images/projects/ (a square image works best)
